Crybot is a modular personal AI assistant built in Crystal. I'm excited to share what I've been working on.

## What is Crybot?

Crybot is your personal AI assistant that you can:

- Chat with through a web interface, Telegram, voice, or command line
- Extend with custom tools and skills
- Automate with scheduled tasks
- Connect to external services via MCP

## Why Crystal?

I wanted to build something that was:

- **Fast** - Crystal's performance is excellent
- **Type-safe** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Concurrent** - Fiber-based concurrency for scalability
- **Self-contained** - Single binary deployment

## Key Features

### Multiple Interfaces

- **Web UI** - Modern browser-based chat
- **REPL** - Fancyline-powered command line
- **Telegram** - Chat from your phone
- **Voice** - Wake word activation

### Skills System

Create reusable AI behaviors as simple markdown files. The agent can reference these skills to perform complex tasks consistently.

### Scheduled Tasks

Automate recurring tasks like daily summaries, news digests, or any periodic AI work.

### MCP Integration

Connect to the growing ecosystem of Model Context Protocol servers for browser automation, filesystem access, web search, and more.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ralsina/crybot.git
cd crybot
shards install
shards build
./bin/crybot onboard
./bin/crybot start
```

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. I have plans for:

- More channels (Discord, Matrix, email)
- More built-in skills
- Better voice interaction
- Enhanced tool capabilities

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ralsina/crybot) and let me know what you think!

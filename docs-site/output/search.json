What is MCP? The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that allows AI applications to connect to external tools and data sources. Think of it as a universal plugin system for AI assistants. How It Works in Crybot Crybot acts as an MCP client, connecting to stdio-based MCP servers. When Crybot starts, it: Connects to all configured MCP servers Discovers what tools each server provides Registers those tools with the agent Makes tools available during conversations Configuration Add MCP servers to your ~/.crybot/config.yml : mcp: servers: - name: playwright command: npx @playwright/mcp@latest - name: filesystem command: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /home/user/Documents Using MCP Tools Once configured, MCP tools are automatically available to the agent: You: Navigate to example.com and take a screenshot\nCrybot: [Uses playwright/browser_navigate] [Uses playwright/browser_take_screenshot] Done! Here's your screenshot... Available MCP Servers The MCP ecosystem is growing fast. Some popular servers: @playwright/mcp - Browser automation @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem - File operations @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search - Web search @modelcontextprotocol/server-github - GitHub integration @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres - Database queries Find more at github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers . Web UI Management Crybot's web UI includes an MCP Servers section where you can: View configured servers Add new servers Remove servers Reload configuration Technical Details The MCP implementation in Crybot: Uses stdio transport for server communication Supports fiber-based non-blocking I/O Handles server failures gracefully Prefixes tool names with server name Integrates with Crybot's existing tool system Future Plans HTTP-based MCP servers Bidirectional streaming Resource support Prompt templates MCP integration makes Crybot incredibly extensible.

Crybot is a modular personal AI assistant built in Crystal. I'm excited to share what I've been working on. What is Crybot? Crybot is your personal AI assistant that you can: Chat with through a web interface, Telegram, voice, or command line Extend with custom tools and skills Automate with scheduled tasks Connect to external services via MCP Why Crystal? I wanted to build something that was: Fast - Crystal's performance is excellent Type-safe - Catch errors at compile time Concurrent - Fiber-based concurrency for scalability Self-contained - Single binary deployment Key Features Multiple Interfaces Web UI - Modern browser-based chat REPL - Fancyline-powered command line Telegram - Chat from your phone Voice - Wake word activation Skills System Create reusable AI behaviors as simple markdown files. The agent can reference these skills to perform complex tasks consistently. Scheduled Tasks Automate recurring tasks like daily summaries, news digests, or any periodic AI work. MCP Integration Connect to the growing ecosystem of Model Context Protocol servers for browser automation, filesystem access, web search, and more.
